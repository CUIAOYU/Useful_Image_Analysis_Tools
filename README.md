# SAM-HQ Image Batch Processing & Analysis Tool

This is a comprehensive GUI application built with PyQt6, designed to streamline and accelerate common image analysis and processing tasks in research and experimental work. It's particularly useful for scenarios requiring batch processing of large image datasets, such as microscopy photos, tissue slice scans, and similar scientific imagery. The tool combines the powerful segmentation capabilities of SAM-HQ (Segment Anything in High Quality) with custom image analysis algorithms to help you automatically extract quantitative information, compare image features, and enhance visual presentation.

## Key Features

The tool consists of **four core functional modules** organized through a tabbed interface:

### 1. Aggregation Analysis
* **Aggregation Metric Definition**: We've defined an "aggregation" score (0-100) that measures how "dark" pixels are. **Darker colors have higher aggregation values**.
    - **Formula**: `Aggregation = 100 - (grayscale_value / 255.0) √ó 100.0`
    - **Example**: Pure black pixels have aggregation of 100, pure white pixels have aggregation of 0
* **Single Image Distribution Analysis**: Select any image to analyze the distribution of aggregation values across all pixels and generate histograms.
* **Automatic Feature Detection**: Automatically identifies and marks peaks and troughs in the distribution, helping you understand the grayscale characteristics of your image content.
* **Detailed Statistics**: Provides key statistics including total pixel count, mean/min/max aggregation values, and more.
* **Chart Export**: Save generated analysis charts as PNG, PDF, or SVG formats.

### 2. Mask Analysis
* **Interactive Mask Generation**: Use SAM-HQ models to generate all possible masks for single images.
* **Visual Mask Selection**: Click directly on images to select/deselect masks, with left-click for selection and right-click for deselection.
* **Real-time Filtering & Calculation**: Apply custom filtering parameters to selected masks and calculate area, intensity, and ratios in real-time.
* **Results Export**: Export analysis results as text files or save marked images.
* **Bulk Selection Operations**: "Select All" and "Deselect All" functions for efficient batch operations.

### 3. Batch Processing
* **Smart File Traversal**: Select a folder and automatically discover all images (including subfolders), supporting `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tif`, `.tiff` formats.
* **SAM-HQ Model Integration**: Load SAM-HQ pretrained models (`.pth` files) for fully automated high-quality image mask generation.
* **Two-Stage Filtering System**:
    * **Stage 1: Region Property Filtering**: Initial screening based on area (A), total aggregation intensity (I), and ratio (R = I/A).
    * **Stage 2: Pixel-Level Aggregation Filtering**: Fine-grained filtering based on pixel-level aggregation value ranges.
* **Smart Output Management**: Processed images are automatically saved to parameter-named output folders to avoid file conflicts.
* **Data Export**: All filtered mask data can be exported as structured `.txt` files.
* **Real-time Progress Monitoring**: Detailed progress bars and logging information.

### 4. SAM-HQ Parameter Configuration
* **Complete Parameter Control**: Access to all adjustable parameters of the SAM-HQ automatic mask generator.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Anaconda

If you don't already have Anaconda installed, visit the [Anaconda Distribution website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to download the installer for your Windows system. Run the installer and follow the prompts. For most options, keeping the default settings is fine.

### Step 2: Create a New Environment

Think of an environment as an isolated "room" where we install all the software libraries this tool needs, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your computer.

1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**: Find and launch "Anaconda Navigator" from the Windows Start menu. The first startup may take some time.

2. **Navigate to Environment Management**: In the Navigator window, click the **"Environments"** tab in the left sidebar.

3. **Create New Environment**:
   * Below the environment list (initially may only show "base (root)"), find and click the **"Create"** button (with plus icon)
   * A "Create new environment" dialog will appear
   * In the **"Name"** field, give your new environment a name, e.g., `sam_hq_env`
   * In the "Packages" section below, ensure **Python** is selected. Click the version dropdown and select **3.11**
   * After confirming the name and Python version, click the **"Create"** button in the bottom right
   * Anaconda will begin creating the environment and installing the specified Python version plus basic packages. Please be patient, this may take several minutes

### Step 3: Install PyTorch (Important)

1. **Open Environment-Specific Terminal**:
   * In Anaconda Navigator's "Environments" interface, **click to select** the `sam_hq_env` environment you just created (ensure it's highlighted)
   * In the top area next to the environment name `sam_hq_env`, you'll see a **green play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** or **dropdown arrow (üîΩ)**. Click this button/arrow
   * In the popup menu, select **"Open Terminal"**
   * The system will open a **black command-line window**. Notice the prompt starts with `(sam_hq_env)`, indicating you're operating within this isolated environment

2. **Install PyTorch**:
   * **Important Note**: PyTorch installation is closely tied to your hardware (especially graphics cards) and required CUDA versions
   * Open your web browser and visit the PyTorch official website: https://pytorch.org/
   * Find the "Get Started" or similar installation guide section on the homepage
   * Make selections based on your situation:
     - **PyTorch Build**: Usually select **Stable**
     - **Your OS**: Select **Windows**
     - **Package**: Select **Pip**
     - **Language**: Select **Python**
     - **Compute Platform**:
       * If your computer has an **NVIDIA graphics card** and you want GPU acceleration (recommended), select a **CUDA** version (like CUDA 11.8 or 12.1)
       * If your computer **doesn't have NVIDIA GPU**, or you're unsure, or you only want CPU computation, select **CPU**
   * After completing the selections above, an installation command will be **automatically generated** at the bottom of the page
   * **Copy the entire generated command**, return to the command-line window, paste, and execute

### Step 4: Install SAM-HQ Core Library

In the same command-line window, execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq.git
cd sam-hq
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: This will install the SAM-HQ version of the segment_anything library, which will override the original segment_anything library.

### Step 5: Install Other Required Libraries

In the same command-line window, execute:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 opencv-python numpy Pillow matplotlib psutil tifffile
```

### Step 6: Install Optional Libraries

```bash
# GPU monitoring library (NVIDIA graphics card users only)
pip install nvidia-ml-py

# COCO tools library (for certain mask formats)
pip install pycocotools
```

**Installation Tips & Common Issues**:
* **pycocotools**: On Windows, installation may fail due to missing C++ build environment. If you encounter errors about `cl.exe` or `Microsoft C++ Build Tools`, try:
  ```bash
  pip install pycocotools-windows
  ```
* **nvidia-ml-py**: If you don't have an NVIDIA graphics card, you can skip this package
* **tifffile**: Without this, you won't be able to read `.tif` or `.tiff` format images

### Step 7: Verify Installation

Run the following Python code in the command line to verify key libraries are correctly installed:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch version:', torch.__version__); print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
python -c "import segment_anything; print('SAM-HQ library imported successfully')"
python -c "import PyQt6; print('PyQt6 imported successfully')"
```

If there are no error messages, installation was successful.

## SAM-HQ Model Setup

SAM processing features require pretrained model files (`.pth`). **These files are large and not included in the code repository - you need to download them yourself.**

### Download Model Files
* Visit the **SAM-HQ official repository**: [https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq)
* **Important**: These are **SAM-HQ** models, not original SAM models!

### Available SAM-HQ Model Versions
Based on supported model types in the code:

* **`vit_h`**: ViT-H SAM-HQ model (largest and most accurate but slowest, recommended for high-quality requirements)
* **`vit_l`**: ViT-L SAM-HQ model (balanced performance and speed)
* **`vit_b`**: ViT-B SAM-HQ model (smaller and faster)

### Model Download Instructions
1. **Create Model Directory**: Create a folder in the SAM-HQ project directory to store models
   ```bash
   mkdir pretrained_checkpoint
   ```

2. **Download Model Files**:
   * Visit the Model Checkpoints section of the [SAM-HQ GitHub repository](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq)
   * The repository provides multiple download links, including official links and Hugging Face mirrors
   * Choose the appropriate model version based on your needs and computer configuration

### Model File Management
* After downloading, save the `.pth` files to an easily accessible location on your computer (recommended: store in the `pretrained_checkpoint` folder)
* When running the tool, click the "Select SAM Model File (.pth)" button in the appropriate tab to tell the program where you've placed the model files

* **Model File**: Select SAM-HQ model weight file (.pth)

#### SAM Processing Two-Stage Filtering Explained:
Combines the Segment Anything Model (AI auto-segmentation) with aggregation analysis. It first automatically identifies individual regions in images, then filters for your targets using your specified conditions (in two stages).

**Stage 1: Regional Property Filtering (A/I/R Thresholds)**:
* Calculate **initial** area, intensity, and ratio for each region found by SAM
* If you've enabled corresponding options, the program checks whether these initial values meet your minimum thresholds
* Any region with **subpar** initial values is **immediately eliminated** and doesn't proceed to the next stage

**Stage 2: Pixel-Level Aggregation Filtering (Min/Max Aggregate Thresholds)**:
* For regions that **passed Stage 1**, examine **every pixel** within them
* Only pixels with aggregation values falling within your specified [minimum, maximum] **range** count as "valid pixels" for that region
* If a region passed Stage 1 but has **no "valid pixels"** after Stage 2 checking, that region **won't be marked or calculated in the final results**

#### Filter Parameter Settings:
* **Stage 1 Filtering**:
    - **Min Area (A)**: Minimum area threshold (pixel count)
    - **Min Intensity (I)**: Minimum total aggregation value threshold
    - **Min Ratio (R=I/A)**: Minimum ratio threshold
    - **Aggregation Range**: Aggregation value range filter (Min-Max)

* **Stage 2 Filtering**:
    - Only pixels within the aggregation range participate in final calculations
    - Complete mask contours are retained for visualization

#### Operation Buttons:
* **Start Processing**: Begin batch processing
* **Stop Processing**: Stop current processing
* **Open Output**: Open output folder
* **Export Data**: Export all numerical data
* **View Output**: View the last processed image

### Tab 4: SAM-HQ Parameter Configuration

Detailed configuration of all SAM-HQ model parameters.

#### Main Parameter Categories:

**üéØ Basic Detection Settings**
* **Points Per Side**: Imagine spreading a grid across the image to find objects - this value is the number of points along each side of the grid. **Higher values mean denser grids**, making it easier to find small objects, but also **slower and more memory/VRAM intensive**
* **Points Per Batch**: Determines how many grid points the GPU processes at once. **Mainly affects VRAM**. If you encounter **"Out of Memory" errors, reduce this value**

**üéõÔ∏è Quality Control**
* **Pred IoU Thresh**: SAM's confidence score for regions it finds (0-1). **Higher values are more demanding**, resulting in less noise but potentially missing some targets
* **Stability Score Thresh**: Measures how stable the found region boundaries are. **Higher values require more stable, clearer boundaries**
* **Stability Score Offset**: Internal parameter used in stability score calculation

**üîÑ Post-processing Settings**
* **Box NMS Thresh**: Prevents the same object from getting multiple boxes. **Lower values are more aggressive** at removing duplicates
* **Min Mask Region Area**: Setting a value **greater than 0** will automatically remove all tiny segmentation results smaller than this pixel count

**‚úÇÔ∏è Large Image Processing**
* **Crop N Layers**: "Tiling" switch for processing very large images. **0 means no tiling**, **setting to 1 or higher** will split large images into many overlapping small tiles for separate processing
* **Crop-related Parameters**: Control tiling overlap and merging strategies

**üíæ Output Format**
* **Output Mode**: Choose mask output format
  - `binary_mask`: Standard format, easiest to use (recommended)
  - `uncompressed_rle`: Compressed format, saves space
  - `coco_rle`: Special compressed format for advanced users
